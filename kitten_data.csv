My Nonna (grandmother) has decided she would like to adopt a cat. Her dog passed away two years ago and she finally feels ready for another animal. (She even has a name picked out already lol).
She owns a large town home in Walnut Grove, 15 minutes away from a veterinary clinic and pet supply store. 

She is looking specifically for a white female cat. She said white with black or other colours is fine as long as she is predominantly white. Short or long hair is fine as she will be taken to the groomers. 

Please email me if you have a kitten OR adult cat that matches her preference. 

Thank you in advance.

I have a male cay who is about 2 years old now. He is neutered and tattooed. He is not liking living in the city. I even built a cage outside my window for him but that is not enough. He wants to roam. He is a good mouser also. However I would like to find him a home on a farm. So he can come and go but does not have to worry about the traffic in the city. Now I do care about this cat very much and his name is Luna but only because we were told he was a female when we first brought him home. I want him to go to a caring and loving family on a farm. I would like at least $75 for him. I am not in a hurry to get rid of him and will vet his new owners carefully.    "

Here are our two lovely cats, girl Flowie and boy GoGo,  we adopted since they were kittens. Now they are six years old.
Born on the same day from the same mother, they’ve got very different personalities.
 The girl is 30% smaller, but very assertive, quick and clever. The boy is loyal, sometimes rough but scared. He’s Emotional and loves to chew grass to release. 
Flowie sometimes would chew head phone wires. 
They grown up together, sharing the same litter box. Sometimes Flowie will cover the pools for GoGo if he forgot. 
We’re planning to travel a couple of months and would like to find people who enjoy living with them. 
Basically they share one can food a day, and I always keep some dry food in two bowls and one cup of water they can share with.
I’ll pay all the food and littering stuff. 
You can visit them first    "

If you're heading out of vacation or even for just a few days for work and it is important to you that your cat is not alone all day with just a sitter coming in to feed and brush your feline for a short duration, than I'm your girl. I recently lost my amazing cat of 19 years old and not ready to get another cat just yet, so cat sitting for now will give me the feline love that I am missing.

I'm available to come and feed your kitty and spend some time with him/her playing, cleaning litter boxes, just hanging out. 

I'm very attuned to the needs of cats, so will be a loving caregiver and you can rest assured that your cat will be very well taken care of. I have also been a volunteer at Vokra, at the cat shelter and my role was cat care. 

Contact me for rates and details.    "

Hi,

My cat desperately needs to be shaved, after many unsuccessful trips to the vet and about $2000 later it seems nothing has helped him with relief from itchiness and we're out of options. He's been dewormed, treated with flea treatment (Advantage as well as Revolution) even though no signs of fleas or dirt, blood work has come back good, thyroid good, appetite is good. Been given antibiotics and an anti itch meds. His diet has been changed to a very limited ingredient food. 

There has been improvement but remains another concern, constant itching.

He is crazy itchy. He has been to the vet over 10 times in the past few months. Normally his groomer comes in home to shave him and she currently does not have a car to get out here. So I'm wondering if there is someone who can volunteer to come help him get a shave as to see the condition of his skin.

The vet sedates animals and because he's older, wasn't comfortable with that. Also he's been shaved a lot through out his life while awake and it's worked out well. 


He doesn't have any matting at all but all this has made him very stressed out. Because of everything he has become more agitated.

If you're someone who loves animals and is good with cats and want to help, please message.    "

We are looking to rehome our beautiful grey, friendly and affectionate 3.5 year old indoor cat; Loki. 

As we are moving to Scotland and we know this would be a very difficult move for Loki (he does not travel particularly well). Therefore we would like to find a home for him here in the Vancouver area. 

He is 3.5 years old, very good natured and a very affectionate indoor cat. He has some energy but is not too vigorous or hyper and is a good companion. He would be accompanied by his cat tower, litter box, litter and food. Very small rehoming fee applies.

We hope to find Loki a loving and safe home and in return he will surely provide wonderful feline companionship.

We would love to chat by phone and meet potential new family for Loki first.

Please get in touch.    "

*Located in Bellingham, WA but willing to drive up to 3 hours and able to cross the border*

Cleo and Nala are two 8-year old spayed females who were surrendered to me when their owner could no longer care for them. I took them in with the intent to finish vetting them and find them a true forever home. They've been with me since late January and will be available by the end of February. They both love to look out the window, so a home with space for them to do that would be great! 

Cleo is the one with more white on her face. She is a little shy but loves attention when she feels comfortable. She even enjoys belly rubs! Cleo recently had a dental cleaning and four teeth extracted, as well as a full blood panel and FeLV/FIV test, which was negative. She is up to date on rabies and FVRCP vaccines (proof provided along with medical records back to 2017). 

Nala is the rounder one with the skinny tail. Nala was more aloof at first and swatted when she was uncomfortable. However, she warmed up to me fairly quickly and is now with me almost constantly. I am taking Nala in for a dental cleaning and full blood panel this month (no extractions expected). She has been tested for FeLV/FIV and was negative. Up to date on rabies and FVRCP vaccines (proof provided along with medical records back to 2017).

They are slowly integrating with my three resident cats so I feel a home with other kitties would be fine, as long as they can be separated for introduction, and the other cats are not aggressive. They should NOT live with dogs due to past bad experiences. Due to their multiple poor living situations in the past, I strongly recommend they go to a home that is adults only, or has older/teen children. 

They will come with starter supplies: dry food and wet food (Purina Beyond Grain Free), two open litter boxes, pine litter, a litter scooping/cleanup kit, two bowls, a small Drinkwell Pet fountain, a selection of toys and beds, one soft sided carrier for each, brushes, nail clippers, and a large 72"" cat tree (if desired). 

**I am asking a rehoming fee of $125 USD for the pair**. I will not split them up as they are littermates and have been together their whole lives. I have a background in cat rescue and adoption and do request that an application be filled out for them, which you can find here: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfmnnftU1eAhvdNx12oVFqgyiYFyuMR4VeXXcBuTaIbP720cQ/viewform?usp=sf_link

If approved, you will be invited to come meet them (though they do get nervous when guests come, so they may not ""show"" well). These girls are very sweet and just need a stable home that will love them and keep them safe and cared for for the rest of their lives.    "

Offering drop in cat sitting in your home or boarding in my home in South Surrey and White Rock

I have cared for cats on and off for friends and family over the years and recently had great experiences offering boarding in my home. I have volunteered as a foster family for a cat and kitten rescue for the last 3 years and have found it to be very rewarding. To date, I have had over 100 fosters cats and kittens in my home!

I love animals and I'm comfortable with ALL types of cats including pregnant mamas, newborn kittens, shy or semi-feral, geriatric and everything in-between.

I'm comfortable giving oral medication as instructed and all kinds of food and litter requirements.

If you'd like drop-in sitting, of course I'd also be happy to water plants, bring in papers and mail and any other house sitting tasks you may need.

Half hour visits include feeding, brushing, playing with toys, trimming nails (if possible--I'm quite good at this!), and lots of cuddles!

1 visit per day-$25
2 visits per day-$40

I also have a secure, spacious room in my home where I could possibly board your cat or cats. Availability is dependent on whether I currently have fosters. This way your kitty would get a LOT more attention and care. Cost is 20/day for 1 cat, $25/day for 2 cats, $30/day for 3. I can only take 1 cat family at a time, so book ahead!

I'd be happy to provide cat and character references. I am a responsible adult (mother to 3 children) with reliable transportation.

Hope to hear from you!    "

Looking to welcome a new member into the family. 

We've done some research and a kitten in the Russian Blue breed would be ideal for our requirements.

We like the temperament, the look and its hyper allergenic nature.

I had arranged to buy a catback from this person and we agreed on a set price of $50 and then he changed the cost when I was getting ready to come pick it up. When I questioned him changing the price last minute from our agreed cost, he kept upping the cost and basically mocking me. DO NOT BUY FROM THIS PERSON. People like this you just can't trust.

Hello!
This is Nona 3.5 years old she so Talented ( I  tought her a few things and she learn pretty fast ☺️) Nona loves cuddling and setting besides you keep your company, she love sleeping between arms or at least her body touch yours 😅😅💜

I had her when she 3 weeks old for my girlfriend but unfortunately we broke up and I found out I'm allergic to cats and my health is getting worse 😔
I can't keep her and I haven't brush her since September!! My ex always took care of her everyday but now I can't get close to her! I just want someone would love her as much I do and care about her and I'm sure she will care about you too!

She probably gonna be angry the first a few days because she got used to be at my place between my care!

It's gonna hurt when she leave but I'll feel better if she in good place!

I didn't want to take any money just want her to be in good place!

Two mostly indoor, friendly affectionate cats need new home due to toddler and new baby. These poor 8 and 9 year old cats have been refusing to come upstairs, are clearly depressed and need someone who will be able to give them some more time. We love these cats, they just will not come around the kids at all. Would consider separating them, but would prefer to keep them together. 
Happy to supply brand new litter box, large supply of food and two carrying cases.

I am rehoming two of my cats, Optimus and Hero, to a good home.  Not asking a fee just that they go to a good home and stay together.  Circumstances has changed and I am taking in a family member unexpected.  They are about 8 and rescues, I've had them for 3 years.  The male (Optimus) is not good with dogs.  They are both extremely loving cats.  Both will curl up with you on the couch or sleep in the bed with you.    "

Georgie Girl comes from a small northern BC community. She is spayed, about two years old. She was recently groomed because her long hair just needed a trim. That would be Georgie after grooming, orange background.

She is a loving, cuddly cat; loves to spend time with her human family. She does live with  other cats, dogs here at the rescue. I think she would do great in a home by herself. In the summer she has spent hours on the patio just enjoying the day. During the cooler days she prefers to be indoors.

We are a small animal rescue committed to rescues from BC Coastal communities and northern BC. Her re-homing fee is $150. Everyone is asked to complete an adoption application to make sure that our animals go to forever homes. Please email for the application.    "
